## ✅ Projections

Projections are used to stop sensitive values from being sent to the client — for example, sending only the **username** and excluding the **password**.

## 🔐 Password Hashing

* Passwords must be **hashed before storing in the database**
* Hashing is **irreversible**
* Common practice is hashing with **12 rounds**
* More rounds = more security but **more processing time**

## 🌐 Public Routes vs Protected Routes

Every API generally has two types of routes:

### Public Routes

* Can be accessed by **any user**
* Example: login, signup

### Protected Routes

* Can be accessed only by **authenticated users**

## 🔑 User Authentication (Simple Explanation)

User authentication means:

> Submitting credentials and receiving a token

Just like:
👉 Paying money and getting a movie ticket
👉 Once you have the ticket (token), you are allowed inside

Once the token is received, the user becomes an **authenticated user**.

---

## 🧾 Steps for User Authentication

1. Receive user credentials (username & password)
2. API verifies the username
3. If username matches:

   * Compare hashed password
4. If password matches:

   * Generate an encrypted token (JWT)
5. Send the token as response to the client

Once credentials are verified, a **JWT token** is created.

## 💾 Token Storage in Browser

Browsers have three main storage locations:

### 1. Local Storage

### 2. Session Storage

### 3. Cookies

### Access by JavaScript:

* Local Storage ✅
* Session Storage ✅
* Normal Cookies ✅

### ❗ Most Secure Option:

**HTTP-only Cookies**

* Cannot be accessed by JavaScript
* Safest place to store JWT tokens after authentication



making authencated request 

when client application makes request after succesull login the hhtponly cookie will beatteced evevry request automatically

the middleware in express can etract the cooie from user using cooike-parser moduel
